# Basics-of-Pandas

Most files have short explanations as comments within the file. Additionally the header of each file loosely provides the aim of the code, what the code demonstrates and possible changes I'd like to make / can be made to the file. The files deal with specific aspects and questions for the dataset they use; this might make it a little harder to follow along with another dataset.

### Motivation
My motivation was to learn the pandas library. 

### Datasets
I have provided the Cars, Travel-log, and Zoo datasets with the repository. They were downloaded from [here](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets). The 4 files named pandas 1-4 work with these datasets. The files named fifa_* use the FIFA 19 player dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
