# Basics-of-Pandas


*I have added the GNU3.0 license as I have used datasets in this repository that are not my personal property. You can find the link to where i downloaded the datasets from* [here](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets)

My motivation to create this repository was to learn the pandas library in the process. If this ends up helping somebody else or results in others telling me how I can improve my code, I will deem the project a success. I shall keep updating the repository as and when I learn new utilities in pandas! Please feel free to clone or suggest more efficient techniques!
