# Basics-of-Pandas

*I have added the GNU3.0 license as I have used datasets in this repository that are not my personal property. You can find the link to where i downloaded the datasets from* [here](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets). 

*In a few files I have used datasets that I found on Kaggle. If you are interested in data science and/or machine learning and don't already know about Kaggle, I suggest you go get yourself an account there as soon as possible! You can interact with a great community and even find access to a number of cool datasets, a link to which I have provided* [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). *I will mention the datasets I have used explicitly below.*

Most files have short explanations as comments within the file. Additionally the header of each file loosely provides the aim of the code, what the code demonstrates and possible changes I'd like to make / can be made to the file. The files deal with specific aspects and questions for the dataset they use; this might make it a little harder to follow along with another dataset.

### Motivation
My motivation to create this repository was to learn the pandas library in the process. If this ends up helping somebody else or results in others telling me how I can improve my code, I will consider it a success. I will keep updating the repository as and when I learn new utilities in pandas. Please feel free to clone or suggest more efficient techniques! Thanks!

### Datasets
I have provided the Cars, Travel-log and Zoo datasets in the repository itself. They were downloaded from the first link that I provided in the header. The 4 files named pandas 1-4 use these three datasets.

The files named fifa_* use the FIFA 19 player dataset available at Kaggle, the link to which I have also provided in the header.
